Welcome to the Olympus documentation
====================================

This documentation is automatically generated based on the code provided with your current
distribution of Olympus. It contains everything you ought to know to get going with Olympus,
perhaps even more.

The majority of this documentation was written by `Stephan Heijl
<http://www.stephanheijl.com>`_. However, any additional modules that have been added to your
distribution will have documentation written by their respective authors. If you are a module author it is your sole responsibility to include any attributions in your
own documentation, if you would like them.

As of version 0.1 most source files contain Nose unittests. They are generally very simple and as such not documented. These methods can be identified by their name, which starts with *test_*. 

This documentation is still a work in progress.
