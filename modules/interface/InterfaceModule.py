""" Interface base class.

Abstract class that provides base classes and access to classes in the ../lib directory
Uses part of the additionalImport script to allow access to the lib classes.
This type of module allows for "interfacing", that is, making the connection between the generated data and humans, through a unified format.
Refer to the page on Interface modules for a list of modules distributed with this version of Olympus.
