Olympus Library Containers
==========================
   
This section of the Olympus Library covers containers of any type. All modules will deliver their output as a class inheriting from StoredObject. This allows any and all output to be stored in the Olympus database when needed and guarantees a number of functions for storing and retrieving information.
