Modules are the components that deliver advanced functionality to Olympus. It should be noted that there is a distinct difference between Python modules and Olympus Modules. The latter may include assets that are required for their operation, whereas native modules technically only include the code that is imported.

Olympus modules are generally divided into 4 categories:

* Acquisition
* Interpretation
* Visualization
* Interface
